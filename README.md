# Quarantino
## [IdleSite.com/quarantino](https://www.idlesite.com/quarantino)

A tiny Javascript game to keep busy during the 2020 quarantine.

## How to run:
- Clone the project.
- `npm install`
- `npm start` (runs by default on localhost:3000)
- The `q` object is globally accessible and can be tweaked from the console to skip levels or tinker with other variables to alter gameplay. 

Have fun!
